# THE BUDDY CLUBHOUSE
### This project features a website for a forever-home for large dogs that have, at some point in their lives, lost their previous homes. To provide the dogs with a balanced life, they are sent on training for particular skills they show an aptitude for. 

### The aim of the website is to:
* give people who love large breed dogs, but might not have the space or time to have one as a regular pet, the opportunity to spend quality time with them
* give the dogs the social interaction with people they need
* generate some donation from users to help with the upkeep of the dogs
