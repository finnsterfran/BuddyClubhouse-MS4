# BUDDY CLUBHOUSE
### This project features a website for a sanctuary for large dogs, where the dogs are permanent residents and are not up for adoption. 
### The aim of the website is to promote a program to combine: 
* people who love large breed dogs but might not have the space or time to have one as a regular pet, but would still love to have some activities and bonding time with one
* dogs that are ready for some activities with and interaction with people
### Visitors can choose from three tier of membership, each tier opening up more options for interaction with the dogs. 
### Members will be able to post a blog of their day with the dog.
